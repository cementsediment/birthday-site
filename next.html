        You keep asking, what I saw? This is what I saw.
        And I am not here to tell that I love you!
        But every time I see an angry Sai, I convince myself that this is you
        and that anger is a temporary part of you and once again happy happy birthday! 🫂
      </p>

      <p>
        I wanna meet you soon at least for the sake of whatever I had with you for these
        11 months even it was nothing for you, it meant the world for me.
        I keep a count – started talking with you on Feb 11 2025 and here I am on Dec 21 2025!

        I know I got angry and spoke words which can never be forgiven for!
        But I ask an heartfelt sorry here, apology is yours to accept but all I wanted
        was a small gesture or talk from you due to which this whole situation raised!
      </p>

      <p>
        For the man, I see in you is this whole background
        (a kind of manifestation is visualisation) – happy birthday!
